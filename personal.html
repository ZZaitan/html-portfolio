    <p>I am an aspiring full-stack web developer with a keen interest in computers and technology. After completing my electrical engineering degree, I decided that I was going to take a break and find something that I really enjoy doing and could think about as a career. I wanted something that I knew would come naturally to me and would compliment my educational history.</p>
    <p>I am currently teaching myself the fundamentals of full-stack web development to find myself a good job in a city. I love Leamington but I'm at a stage in my life where I need more out of the place I live, especially after living in Liverpool for 4 years and then returning home.</p>
