    <h2>Employment</h2>

    <h3>Thorntons Leamington Spa</h3>
    <p>November 2016 - April 2019</p>
    <p>I worked for nearly 2 years at Thorntons as a sales assistant before training up to the position of senior sales in August 2018. My role as a sales assistant required me to interact with customers in a variety of ways, from greeting them upon entry to the shop, to answering questions about our products and services. As part of my senior sales position my responsibilities included both opening and closing the shop alone, counting money, banking and various stock management jobs. Most of my shifts as senior sales assistant required me to be the supervisor for that day, being responsible for the staff and the shop. As part of my training, I have also received a level 2 certificate in food safety, issued internally by the company.</p>
    <p>For 3 months there was a transition period between managers, and I was asked to be acting manager during this time. My time as acting manager allowed me to learn various managerial skills such as creating a weekly rota for an entire team, processing the wages of each team member, and amending the weekly stock order. It also gave me a chance to work on my team-building and motivational skills, as well as effective time management of both myself and the rest of the team. The shop also experiences monthly mystery shopper reports, one of which I was solely responsible for achieving 100% in.</p>
    
    <h3>Savi's Cafe</h3>
    <p>May 2019 - September 2019</p>
    <p>I worked at Saviâ€™s taking on both front-of-house and culinary roles. My front of house roles included barista training, sandwich preparation, taking kitchen orders, various cleaning activities and working the till. I also handled admin work including cashing up and ordering stock and consumables. My cooking roles included preparing meals for customers and ingredients for the front-of-house staff. These tasks have taught me a wide array of culinary techniques and food safety information, further building on my level 2 certificate.</p>

    <h3>Pizza Hut Liverpool One</h3>
    <p>October 2021 - December 2021</p>
    <p>At Pizza Hut my role was back-of-house, working predominantly in the kitchen area. As the second busiest Pizza Hut in the UK, I took on a wide variety of tasks, having to prepare large amounts of food in a high-pressure environment. All the kitchen staff were trained to work at any station within the kitchen, which has allowed me to further develop my culinary skills across all many areas such as food storage and preparation, serving orders to the floor staff and preparing ingredients and consumables for the next day. The COVID-19 pandemic put a huge emphasis on hygiene, allowing me to learn more about cleaning and sanitation of the workplace and equipment.</p>
